Last thing I did was update the create unit form to change the unit status to vacant, and 
it works to create a form, but the bad thing is it also moves the unit to the bottom of the list 
when the page renders, instead of staying in order. Need to change this so they generate alphabetically




1. customer info page
    -Create "tenant manager page"
2. do basic styling
    -in store, option to view occupied, view vacant, view by type, etc
3. add forms, buttons to rent units etc
    -new customer form
    -select unit
    -drop down list of customers (for now on a special 'rent unit' page)
        -put linnk to 'rent unit' page in the unit manager page
